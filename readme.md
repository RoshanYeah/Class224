Regarding your question about a, a+, and +a:

"a": This mode stands for "append." When you open a file in "a" mode, the file is opened for writing, but the contents are preserved, and new data written to the file will be added to the end. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

"a+": This mode stands for "append and read." It is similar to "a", but it allows both reading and writing. The file is opened for both reading and writing. Again, if the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

"+": The "+" character can be used as a prefix with other modes to indicate that the file should be opened in both read and write modes. For example, "r+" means open for both reading and writing, and "w+" means open for reading and writing, truncating the file if it exists.

# Append data to a file
with open("file.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Appended text\n")

# Append and read from a file
with open("file.txt", "a+") as file:
    file.write("Appended text\n")
    file.seek(0)
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
    
# Open for both reading and writing
with open("file.txt", "r+") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    file.write("Modified content\n")
